# Multiple-Disease-Prediction
## About

*This web app provides a user-friendly interface to predict multiple diseases based on various input features. The machine learning models used in this application are trained on relevant datasets to make accurate predictions.*

The diseases currently supported by this web app include:
- Diabetes
- Parkinson's disease
- Heart disease
## Models

The machine learning models used in this web app are trained on publicly available datasets specific to each disease. Here is a brief description of each model:

- Diabetes Model: This model predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

- Parkinson's Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of Parkinson's disease in a person based on features extracted from voice recordings.

- Heart Disease Model: This model predicts the presence of heart disease based on various clinical and demographic features of a person.
